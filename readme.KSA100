Analysis Highlights (Potential)
Once the data types are correctly converted, you can perform various analyses, such as:

Time Series Analysis: Plotting the Close price over time to observe overall trends, bull/bear markets, and significant events.

Volatility Analysis: Examining the daily High-Low range or standard deviation of Change to understand market volatility.

Volume Trends: Analyzing trading Volume to identify periods of high or low market activity.

Daily Returns: Calculating daily percentage changes in Close price to analyze returns distribution.

Correlation: Investigating relationships between Volume and Change, or other derived metrics.

Moving Averages: Computing simple or exponential moving averages to identify trends and potential buy/sell signals.
