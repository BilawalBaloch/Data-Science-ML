## About This Repository

This repository showcases my journey and learning in the field of Machine Learning. It includes implementations of popular algorithms from scratch (in some cases) or using libraries like Scikit-learn, along with practical applications on diverse datasets. Each notebook aims to demonstrate the specific algorithm's use, data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Project List & Descriptions

Below is a categorized list of the Jupyter notebooks, along with a brief description of what each file covers.

### Regression Models

These notebooks focus on predicting continuous output values.

  * `linear_regression.ipynb`: A foundational notebook demonstrating the principles and implementation of simple linear regression.
  * `ML_LinearRegression_.ipynb`: Further exploration and implementation of linear regression, potentially covering more advanced aspects or different datasets.
  * `all_regression.ipynb`: A comprehensive notebook likely covering various regression techniques beyond linear regression, such as polynomial regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.
  * `FOREST_TREE_SVR.ipynb`: **Focuses on applying Forest-based (likely Random Forest Regressor) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models.** This notebook explores their use for regression tasks and compares their performance.
  * `Regression_SVM_R.ipynb`: Dedicated to exploring Support Vector Machines (SVM) specifically for regression tasks.
  * `London_Housing_project.ipynb`: A practical project applying regression techniques to the London Housing dataset to predict housing prices or related metrics.

### Classification Models

These notebooks deal with predicting categorical output labels.

  * `logical_classification.ipynb`: Introduces the fundamental concepts and implementation of a basic classification model, possibly a very simple logical classifier or an early look at logistic regression.
  * `ML_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: A detailed notebook on Logistic Regression, a widely used algorithm for binary classification.
  * `decision_tree.ipynb`: Explores the Decision Tree algorithm for classification, covering its structure, training, and interpretation.
  * `random_forest.ipynb`: Implements and demonstrates the Random Forest classifier, an ensemble method known for its robustness and accuracy.
  * `all_classification.ipynb`: A broad notebook encompassing various classification algorithms, potentially comparing their performance on a dataset.
  * `SVC+all_sklearn_.ipynb`: Focuses on Support Vector Classification (SVC) using Scikit-learn, potentially covering different kernels and parameters.
  * `iris.classification,model` (likely a typo, refers to a notebook): A specific project dedicated to classifying the Iris flower dataset, a classic machine learning problem, likely using various classification models.
  * `iris_data.ipynb`: Likely contains data loading, exploration, and initial preprocessing steps for the Iris dataset before applying classification models.

### Fundamental Concepts

These notebooks cover core machine learning concepts and utilities.

  * `concepts_of_ML_ipyn.ipynb`: An introductory notebook explaining fundamental machine learning concepts, terminology, and workflows.

## How to Run the Notebooks

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

    (Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub path)

2.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

      * `numpy`
      * `pandas`
      * `scikit-learn`
      * `matplotlib`
      * `seaborn`
      * `jupyter` or `jupyterlab`

    You can install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open a browser window with the Jupyter interface. You can then navigate to and open any of the `.ipynb` files.

4.  **Google Colab:** Many notebooks were "Created using Colab." You can directly open these notebooks in Google Colab for an environment with pre-installed libraries and GPU access (if needed). Simply upload the `.ipynb` file to Colab or open it directly from GitHub if Colab supports it.

## Data Files

  * `Linear Regression - Sheet1.csv`: A dataset likely used for linear regression examples.
  * `KSA100.ipynb`: While this is a notebook, it might involve a specific dataset related to KSA100 (perhaps a stock index or similar financial data).
  * `LinearRegression.2025.csv.file`: Another CSV file related to linear regression.

Please ensure these CSV files are in the same directory as their respective notebooks or update the file paths within the notebooks if you place them elsewhere.

## README for `FOREST_TREE_SVR.ipynb`

Here's the specific README for the `FOREST_TREE_SVR.ipynb` file, as requested. You can either include this content directly within the main `README.md` under its project description, or create a separate `FOREST_TREE_SVR_README.md` if you prefer very detailed individual documentation for each notebook. I recommend keeping it in the main README for a cleaner repository structure.

### `FOREST_TREE_SVR.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook explores and implements two powerful regression algorithms: **Random Forest Regressor** and **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**.

**Purpose:**
The primary goal of this notebook is to:

1.  Demonstrate the application of Random Forest and SVR for solving regression problems.
2.  Compare the performance, strengths, and weaknesses of these two distinct approaches.
3.  Illustrate the necessary steps for data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation for each algorithm.

**Key Topics Covered:**

.
.
  * **Support Vector Regressor (SVR):**
      * Introduction to Support Vector Machines for regression.
      * Understanding the epsilon-insensitive tube.
      * Impact of different kernel functions (linear, RBF, polynomial).
      * Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `C`, `epsilon`, `gamma`).
  * **Data Preprocessing:** Likely includes handling missing values, feature scaling (especially important for SVR), and encoding categorical features if present.
  * **Model Evaluation:** Metrics relevant to regression tasks such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared ($R^2$) score.
  * **Random Forest Regressor:**
      * Ensemble learning concept (bagging).
      * Training multiple decision trees.
      * Aggregating predictions for robust output.
      * Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., `n_estimators`, `max_depth`).


**Usage:**
This notebook can be run locally using a Jupyter environment or directly opened in Google Colab. It requires standard machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.
